# Open Terms Archive - template for declarations

This is a template for the `declarations` repository of [Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org)

Please refer to the doc on [How to use a template on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

When creating from this template, please keep the naming structure of `<instance-name>-declarations` in order to keep consistency across repos and organisations.

Once cloned, just launch

```
./init.sh <instance-name>
```

This will replace the corresponding variables in the files and remove the now useless files.
